Design Todo things:
    Model questions and implement the same
        word2vec embedding - find out similar text to recognize similar questions on quora that could possibly contain a answer
    Modeling similarity method
        cosine similarity between word2vec
        Jaccard similarity
        different embeddings + K-means
        different embeddings + cosine similarity
        word2vec + smooth inverse frequency + cosine similarity
        


Useful concepts:
    Attention scores - given a vector of words it gives scores for each word in entire corpus for which to focus on


Programming to do things:
    - given a question extract links of list of similar questions from quora
